# Image-Processing-Floodfill-Prototypes

The Mack Lab provided slides of of endothelial cells under variable laminar fluid flow, with 4 channels, each corresponding to DAPI stained nuclei, NOTCH1 proteins, tagged antibodies attached to Cavin proteins (indicative of caveolae positioning), as well as BAPTA-1-AM ester (indicative of calcium concentration), which is represented as the dye channel. I was tasked with processing the channels by categorizing the morphology of various structures in each microscope image.
